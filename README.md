# SimplePerceptron
This is a simple model for a perceptron learning algorithm for a linearly separable dataset.

## Description 🧐

This is a program that designed to train a perceptron learning model on a linearly seprable dataset. The dataset is labeled with -1 or 1.

After implementing the perceptron algorithm, a clean and clear separation line that separates the negative example from the positive examples have been found, as shown below. The weights that define the decision boundary are [-5, -2, 39]
